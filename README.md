# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Science & Commerce (Majoring in Applied Stats, Accounting & Infosys)
- I am taking STATS 220 because it's a compulsory paper under the Stats Major. 
- I am interested in learning about data science in R, including data wrangling, visualtion, reproducible reporting and ethical data practices.
